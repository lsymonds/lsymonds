### ðŸ‘‹ Well hello there

I'm Liam Symonds, a buzzword laden, dog worshipping, biscuit demolishing, full-stack software developer based in the East of
England. By day, I work as a Senior Full Stack Software Developer (much wow) at BossLabs Ltd where I hack away on many, 
many different projects. By night, I mostly sit and do nothing, but can sometimes be found to be writing software listed 
below or demolishing things to rebuild them better in the physical world.

### ðŸ”­ I'm working on

Right now, I'm working on **Baseline** - a set of packages, projects and services that make building modern .NET 
applications easier. You can find them pinned below, or find all of them by searching through my repositories.

### ðŸ¤” Pull requests and contributions

I like releasing open source software, but I don't like the administrative work and the emotional toll that comes along
with it when you allow pull requests and code contributions from unknown parties. It also limits my ability to monetise 
any work in the future, without forcing every contributor to sign a CLA (which I don't want to have to do).

I still welcome suggestions, issues and requests in all forms to my open source repositories.

### ðŸ“« Find me on the rest of the interwebz

I tend to stay off regular forms of social media but you can find the places I hang out below.
